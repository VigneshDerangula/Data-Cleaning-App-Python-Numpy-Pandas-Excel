### **Data Cleaning Application Using Python**

**Project Overview:**
The Data Cleaning Application is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of cleaning and preprocessing datasets. It efficiently identifies and handles duplicate records, manages missing values, and ensures that datasets are ready for further analysis. This application is particularly useful for data analysts, data scientists, and businesses seeking to maintain high data quality for informed decision-making.

**Key Features:**

1. **File Format Support:**
   - Supports both CSV and Excel file formats, allowing users to easily upload their datasets for cleaning.

2. **Duplicate Detection and Management:**
   - Automatically identifies duplicate records within the dataset.
   - Provides an option to save duplicates to a separate file for review, ensuring no valuable data is lost.
   - Removes duplicates from the main dataset, streamlining data integrity.

3. **Missing Value Handling:**
   - Analyzes the dataset for missing values and provides a summary of missing data by column.
   - Offers customizable options for handling missing values:
     - For numeric columns, fills missing values with the mean of the column.
     - For non-numeric columns, drops rows containing missing values to ensure data consistency.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Interactive prompts guide users through the process of inputting the dataset's file path and desired name for the cleaned dataset.
   - Provides informative messages throughout the cleaning process, enhancing user experience.

5. **Data Quality Assurance:**
   - Outputs the cleaned dataset in a new CSV file, preserving the original dataset while providing a ready-to-use version for analysis.
   - Displays the dimensions of the cleaned dataset, giving users immediate feedback on the cleaning results.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: The primary programming language for building the application.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, enabling easy handling of data structures.
- **NumPy**: Employed for numerical operations, particularly in handling missing values.
- **OpenPyXL**: Utilized for reading Excel files.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn (Optional)**: Could be integrated for visualizing data before and after cleaning, providing insights into the impact of the cleaning process.

**Conclusion:**
The Data Cleaning Application is an essential tool for anyone working with data, as it significantly reduces the time and effort required for data preprocessing. By automating critical tasks such as duplicate detection and missing value management, it allows users to focus on analysis and decision-making, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable results.
